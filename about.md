# About us

AHA-Project is maintained and developed by researchers at the Energy Systems Innovation Center (ESIC) within the school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Washington State University (WSU).

The original goal was to help users in the power industry understand the component interactions of various critical infrastructure software packages and help to identify when systems were not configured securely.
 
Since AHA-Project's inception, our scope has increased to encompass detection of general system and application security features for both Windows plaforms and certain Linux distributions.
