# About AHA

AHA is a suite of tools, presently this is two halves, the scraper component available for [Linux](https://github.com/aha-project/AHA-Scraper-Lin) or [Windows](https://github.com/aha-project/AHA-Scraper-Win) which gathers the information, and [AHA-GUI](https://github.com/aha-project/AHA-GUI) visualizer which displays the results of the scraper.

# Using AHA-Scraper

## Running on Windows

### Dependencies

The Windows AHA-Scraper has no real dependencies, but presently only works on x86_64. 32bit support will be added at some future date.

### Usage

use git clone, the github client, or click 'download project' to get the repsitory on your computer. Then cd into the directory and run:

```powershell.exe -File .\AHA-Scraper.ps1```

Upon completion, `BinaryAnalysis.csv` will be produced containing the results of the scan.

#### Command Line Options

By default the script scans for a few seconds, to generate at least some traffic statistics on supported platforms (so you can see which connections had 0 bytes transfered, and which had thousands, and see connections come and go over time). To scan for more than a few seconds use the -SecondsToScan argument to provide a number of seconds to scan. For example:

```powershell.exe -File .\AHA-Scraper.ps1 -SecondsToScan 60```

Example:

Note: depending on your host security setup, you may need to Allow unsigned powershell scripts: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` and hit `y` and enter. At some future date we will look into signing the necessary files to avoid this.

## Running on Linux

Intial support for linux distros (presently tested on RHEL/Fedora/CentOS and Ubuntu/Debian) is now available!

### Dependencies
The Linux AHA-Scraper presently has no real dependencies, but is only tested on 64bit versions of RHEL and Debian derivitives (RHEL7/CentOS7/Ubuntu 18.04/Kali Linux (at present) specifically). Support for other distros will evolve and improve as time goes on. As of August 1st 2018 there are no longer any known issues that impede the general usage of the Linux scraper. In the future we will be releasing a python 2.7 version (summer 2019?) followed by a migration to python 3.x in sept/oct.

### Usage
use git clone, the github client, or click 'download project' to get the repsitory on your computer. Then cd into the directory and run:

```./AHA-Scraper-Linux.sh```

Upon completion, `BinaryAnalysis.csv` will be produced containing the results of the scan.

Note: you may need to make the script executable before running by using `chmod +x ./AHA-Scraper-Linux.sh`

# Using AHA-GUI

## Dependencies and Installation

AHA-GUI requires the latest Java 1.8.0+. We suggest OpenJDK on *nix platforms or AdoptOpenjdk.net installers for macOS and Windowsâ„¢. The Oracle installers will work as well, but their recent license changes have made it more trouble than they are worth to install, thus we only test against OpenJDK on linux and AdoptOpenJDK installed 1.8 and JDK11 LTS on macOS and Windows. While we attempt to test things as much as possible, we are researchers. There is no warranty or guarantee this software will work as expected.

Get the current built and zipped version from our [AHA-GUI Releases Page](https://github.com/aha-project/AHA-GUI/releases) and unzip it in a place of your choosing.

Note: If you would like to build from source there are additional requirements and instructions, please refer to the readme in the AHA-GUI repository for more info.

## Running AHA-GUI

1. When you start the GUI it will ask you which file you would like to open. The other instructions about moving files or running with command line arguments to select file still work, but are no longer required.
1. ~~Move or copy the `BinaryAnalysis.csv` output from AHA-Scraper into the directory that contains AHA-GUI.jar~~
1. To start AHA-GUI either double click `AHA-GUI.jar` or open a terminal/powershell and cd to the correct directory and type `java -jar AHA-GUI.jar`


If you invoke from the commandline, the following commandline arguments can be used:
 * --debug : print additional information to console while running
 * --verbose : print additional information to console while running, but not as much as debug. Useful for troubleshooting issues with input files.
 * --single : use single lines between nodes with multiple connections
 * --bigfont : use 18pt font instead of the default 12pt font (good for demos)
 * --forceJMenu : on macs, force use of normal JMenu rather than using the traditional macOS menubar at the top of the screen
 * --notheme : attempt to minimize theming information set on gui components so that the OS theme will be used. Unsupported / components may be oddly sized.
 * --noforcescale : ignore the app attempting to force the scale down to 100% to avoid several existing graphstream bugs.
 * --updateFile : update a given inputFile with information about attacksurface/threats from internet sources (presently aDolus)
 * scorefile=scorefile.csv : use the scorefile specified after the equals sign
 * inputFile=inputFile.csv : use the inputFile specified after the equals sign
 * credsFile=inputFile.csv : use the credsFile for the credentials to update the input file (used with --updateFile) specified after the equals sign

## AHA-GUI Main Window Walkthrough

In the above image we can see the gui as it appears at launch. The lefthand side is the main AHA-GUI view area, the righthand side is the Graph Node Inspector which shows details of the graph nodes when they are clicked.

The main GUI is largely comprised of the graph view which shows external conenctions in red, internal connections in white, and duplicate connections in darker versions of each of those colors (i.e. darker red, and gray for duplicate connections). Connections in TIME_WAIT, CLOSE_WAIT, SYN_SENT, etc. are drawn as a dashed line. All solid connections with the exception of the connections drawn to the "External" virtual node are established connections. 

The "External" virtual node is drawn to help visualize any service which has a port bound that would allow connection from an external entity. This node can be hidden by selecting "Hide Ext Node" from the bottom area of the main graph view.

**An Example Video Demo of AHA-GUI Features (link to video hosted on youtube) is also available:**

[![AHA-GUI December 2018 Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/D_4unUlMa2Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_4unUlMa2Q)

Along the bottom of the main AHA-GUI window there is a search bar. The search bar allows graph nodes/edges to either be emphasized (highlighted/edged in blue) or hidden (entirely hidden from the graph). Example syntax for the search bar:

`processname==svchost.exe` will emphasize svchost.exe
`~processname==spoolsv.exe` will hide spoolsv.exe
`processname!=svchost.exe` will emphasize everything that is *not* svchost.exe
`~processname==spoolsv.exe` will hide everything that is *not* spoolsv.exe

These terms can also be OR-ed together with the `||` symbol:

`processname==svchost.exe || ~processname==spoolsv.exe` will emphasize svchost.exe and hide spoolsv.exe at the same time. Please note this syntax is lazily evaluated from beginning to end per token. This means we split the complex query up by `||` and then process starting with the leftmost term, moving rightward. Thus if there is any conflict between the terms, the rightmost will win.



Graph view options and other features can be accessed through the menus (as of 0.6.8, previously they were buttons on the main application window). On macOS by default they will show up in the regular operating system menu bar on the top of the screen. All other platforms will have the menu at the top of each application window (or optionally on macOS if using the appropriate command line option).

File Menu:
 - Open... : This allows you to select a file. If a file is currently loaded, this will be closed and a new file loaded.
 - Open Data View : This opens the data view window which has a textual spreadsheet like representation of the graph data. This view will be explained in a later section of this document.
 - Update File... : This will attempt to use remote database credentials (default stored in credentials.txt in the same directory as AHA-GUI.jar) to update the currently opened file with information from the remote database, and then reload the resultant updated file.
 - Exit : Exits AHA-GUI.
 
 View Menu: 
 - Hide Windows Operating System Processes : Hides operating system processes which can sometimes clutter the view such as svchost.exe, spoolsv.exe, lsass.exe, and others. This is presently defined by an internal list of application paths, which will probably some day be split out into a config file similar to MetricsTable.cfg
 - Show External Node : this will show/hide the virtual "External" node and all connections to it to help unclutter the graph.
 - Use DNS Names : switches Ext_<IP> format names to Ext_<DNS Name>. Example: would switch "Ext_10.0.0.1 to Ext_SomeHost".
 - Use Custom Scorefile : Overlays custom information from a custom scorefile. Default filename is scorefile.csv. There is an example for the custom scorefile in the AHA-GUI repository in the resources directory. You can use custom scorefile filenames by specifying scorefile=<path/to/customscorefile.csv> on the commandline when staring AHA-GUI.
 ----
 - Show Only Matched Metrics : only show matched metrics (checked by defult) which will only show the score rules which matched on the selected node.
 - Show Score Metric Specifics : show metric specifics, which will show exactly which criteria matched.
 - Update on MouseOver : updates the bottom summary view and graph inspector every time you hover over a new node on the graph rather than requiring a click on a node to update the info views.
 ---
 - Show Connectionless Nodes : Show nodes with no pipe/tcp/udp/etc connections to other nodes in the graph.
 - Show Pipe : Show nodes which have named pipe connections between them.
 - Show TCP : Show nodes which have TCP connections between them.
 - Show UDP : Show nodes which have bound UDP sockets on the graph.
 ---
 - Normal Score Method : Normal uses the "Normal" score method described later which uses metrics from the MetricsTable.config located in the same directory as the AHA-GUI.jar.
 - WorstCommonProc Score Method (Beta) : WorstCommonProc gives all processes with the same username the worst score for any proc under that user.
 - Relative Score Method (Beta) : A beta score method that tries to use relative weights, and relativity to nodes that score poorly to weight neighbors

 Window Menu: 
 - Reset Zoom: this button will reset the graph scale if things go awry, as they sometimes do.

## Remote databases
AHA-GUI supports looking up file hashes in remote databases. Currently [aDolus](https://www.adolus.com), an ICS Whitelist database, is the supported option. Using the `API Access` page on aDolus, get your API key. Paste the key in a file called `credentials.txt` and put it in the same directory as `AHA-GUI.jar`. When loading a file with hashes (requires AHA-Scraper Windows v0.8.5+), you will be able to either use the --updateFile commandline switch or use the `Update File...` command from the file menu. This will ask aDolus about each of the unique hashes found in the input file over an HTTPS connection, update the file with the results, and then reload the GUI (assuming the gui is running -- not applicable if you're just updating files using the cli method). Currently the aDolus file score, the quantity and numeric score of each CVE, the worst CVE (highest number), method of data entry into aDolus (parner submission, etc), and last time file was updated are what are written into the file after updating, and what are exposed in the GUI.

  
## AHA-GUI Data View Walkthrough  

There are presently two tabs in the Data View: Vulnerabilty Metrics, and Listening Processes.

### Vulnerability Metrics
![Image](https://aha-project.github.io/images/AHA-GUI-DataView-VulnMetrics-v0.6.8.png)
This view shows a summary of the evaluated graph, and also reflects what is produced in the AHA-GUI-Report.csv 
The top portion shows overall statistics as well as when the scan data was taken/etc.
Below that is a table reflecting what is visible in the graph. Each row is a visible process/graph node, with useful data shown about each process, which is a much quicker way to compare things than attempting to click on each node in the graph and see values. Future versions will allow node highlighting in the graph based on clicks in the data view, and will probably allow multiple inspectors to also help facilitate process comparisons.

### Listening Processes
![Image](https://aha-project.github.io/images/AHA-GUI-DataView-ListeningProcs-v0.6.8.png)
This view shows all bound ports visible in the graph, and which processes they are bound to, which helps give an overall view of services in the graph, as well as which are bound to internal only ports vs externally visible ports.
  
## Attack Surface Scoring methodology
As noted above in the AHA-GUI walkthrough, there are several scoring methods, but we will start with the most basic. The standard scoring method used in AHA-GUI is called "Normal". This applies rules from the MetricsTable.cfg located within the same directory as AHA-GUI.jar which is editable as a text file, and contains a default ruleset as well as an explanation of ho w to create new rules.

One thing to keep in mind for the scoring methods discussed in this section, is that they apply to the data that is available. In this case the data was gathered via curports, which is like a very advanced version of netstat (linux uses netstat and supporting other scripts), which provides us with processes and their open ports. We then make further passes on this data to determine security features of the executable binaries which are running for each process, as well as another pass to determine effective process priveleges. While this is a very interesting dataset to analize please note that it does not as yet include any other platform specific security feaures such as ACL discovery, or reading of local machine firewall rules. This means that if the local firewall is active, that would impact established connections (i.e. they would probably not be established if that's what the firewall is there to do), but we will still show ports that are bound on externally available IP address/Port combos as externally available. It is up to the user to audit their firewall/ACLs and ensure that the processes we discovered which could be available from external machines/networks/hosts/etc are properly firewalled.

In general, other scoring methods utilize the outputs of the "Normal" scoring algorithm, and are either asigning weight by positionts in the node graph, or attempting to suss out other connections that are not visible via the tcp connection graph, such as connections by user account (WorstProcScore) or increase/reduction of attackability relative to the externally accessible nodes in the graph (ECScore).
